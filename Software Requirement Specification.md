## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for **The Quad**, a University Event Planner. This SRS outlines the specifications for the development of a web-based platform aimed at streamlining event scheduling, resource management, and event marketing for university communities. It is intended for use by the development team, project stakeholders, and future maintainers.

### 1.2 Scope
**The Quad** will serve as a centralized platform for both formal and informal university events. Key functionalities include:
- Scheduling and managing events.
- Managing resources such as rooms and equipment.
- Providing tools for event marketing and promotion.
- Facilitating user interactions and engagement through an intuitive interface.

The system is designed to support two primary categories of events:
- **Formal Events:** Organized by the Students Union or clubs (e.g., speaker series, workshops).
- **Informal Events:** Student-led initiatives (e.g., group study sessions, social meetups).

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **SRS:** Software Requirements Specification.
- **UI:** User Interface.
- **UX:** User Experience.
- **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **REST:** Representational State Transfer.
- **Stack:** React, Express, Node.js with Cloudflare Workers, D1, and R2.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
**The Quad** is a standalone web application built using React, Express, and Node.js with Cloudflare services. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with university resources and will be developed using industry best practices. The application will communicate with a Cloudflare D1 SQL database to manage events and resource bookings, use R2 for object storage, and leverage Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions, providing a responsive interface using React.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The main functions of **The Quad** include:
- **Event Scheduling:** 
  - Create, modify, and delete events.
  - Drag-and-drop calendar interface.
  - Event recurrence and template creation.
- **Resource Management:** 
  - Check real-time availability of rooms and equipment.
  - Automated booking requests and conflict resolution.
- **Event Marketing:** 
  - Create and publish event pages.
  - Support for multimedia content (images, videos).
  - RSVP management, waitlist functionality, and social media integration.
- **User Management:** 
  - Role-based access control (administrators, formal event organizers, and student users).
  - Registration and authentication.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Formal Event Organizers:**  
  Users from the Students Union or clubs who require advanced scheduling and resource management features.
- **Informal Event Organizers:**  
  Students planning peer-led events who need a simple interface for scheduling and promotion.
- **General Users:**  
  University students looking to browse, filter, and join events of interest.
- **Administrators:**  
  Users with elevated privileges for overseeing event scheduling, user management, and system configurations.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Client-Side:**  
  Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Server-Side:**  
  Node.js/Express running on a Linux-based server and Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions.
- **Database:**  
  Cloudflare D1 SQL database.
- **Storage:**  
  Cloudflare R2 object storage for images and files.
- **Development Environment:**  
  Docker containers (optional) or local installations for development and testing.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- **Technology Constraints:**  
  The application will be built using JavaScript for both client and server. SQL will be used for database operations.
- **Security Constraints:**  
  Data privacy and security measures must be implemented to protect sensitive user information.
- **Performance Constraints:**  
  The system should be responsive with minimal downtime, even under peak usage conditions during major campus events.
- **Interface Constraints:**  
  The UI must be accessible and responsive, adhering to modern web accessibility standards.

### 2.6 User Documentation
User documentation will include:
- **Online Help:** Context-sensitive help integrated within the web application.
- **User Manuals:** Detailed guides for different user roles.
- **Training Materials:** Tutorials, quick start guides, and possibly video walkthroughs.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Assumes that users have access to modern web browsers.
- Depends on the reliability of Cloudflare D1 database and R2 storage.
- Depends on Cloudflare Workers for serverless backend functionality.
- Assumes collaboration and timely feedback from university stakeholders and potential end-users.
